# PersonalWebsite
During this project I intend to create a personal site in order to make it my CV where I will put my work as well as my previous / future experiences, training ... etc. For the IHM I expect to respect the mv * pattern with the Angular framework. Being in exams period I have for the moment just implemented (in ~30 mins) a simple view with html and css to mark the beginning.
